# The Weasel Program

This program is an implementation of Richard Dawkins's famous [Weasel program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program).

The concept behind this program is to demonstrate a simple kind of evolution. In addition to the classic Dawkins mode, it also implements a simple sexual reproduction mode. In sexual reproduction mode, two parents are blended to create the child by flipping a coin and uses one parent or the other for each character.

More discussion to follow.
